# Vortex-Panel-Method
A MATLAB code to calculate the potential flow around an arbitrary airfoil 
The code is based on the theory from from Kuethe and Chow - "Foundations-of-Aerodynamics". The code needs an input file containing the coordinates of the airfoil.
This can be obtained from Airfoil Tools or other sources. 
Make sure that the cooridinates are sorted as follows, trailing edge -> lower surface -> leading edge -> upper surface -> trailing edge.
